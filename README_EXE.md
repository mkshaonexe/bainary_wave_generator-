## 🔊 How Binaural Beats Work

Binaural beats play two slightly different frequencies:
- **Left ear:** Base frequency (e.g., 200 Hz)
- **Right ear:** Base + Theta frequency (e.g., 206 Hz)

Your brain perceives the **6 Hz difference**, which can help entrain your brainwaves to the theta frequency range.

## 🧘 What Are Theta Waves?

Theta waves (4-8 Hz) are associated with:
- Deep meditation and relaxation
- The hypnagogic state (between wake and sleep)
- Enhanced creativity and intuition
- Access to subconscious mind
- Reduced anxiety and stress
