## 🧠 What are the Different Frequencies?

### 🧠 Solfeggio Frequency (852 Hz)
- **Ancient sacred frequency**
- Awakens intuition and inner strength
- Helps clear overthinking and mental clutter
- Returns to spiritual order and clarity
- Promotes calm, peaceful mental state

### 📚 Beta Waves (14-20 Hz)
- **Active concentration and focus**
- Improves attention and working memory
- Enhances learning and cognitive performance
- Perfect for study and work sessions

### 😴 Delta Waves (1-3 Hz)
- **Deep sleep and healing**
- Mimics slow-wave sleep patterns
- Helps with insomnia and sleep disorders
- Promotes physical healing and recovery

## 🔊 How Binaural Beats Work

Binaural beats work by playing two slightly different frequencies in each ear:
- **Left ear**: Base frequency (e.g., 200 Hz)
- **Right ear**: Base frequency + Theta frequency (e.g., 206 Hz)

Your brain perceives the difference (6 Hz in this example) as a rhythmic beat, which can help entrain your brainwaves to the theta frequency range.

## 🎧 Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Headphones**: Binaural beats only work when each ear receives a different frequency
2. **Find Your Sweet Spot**: Experiment with different theta frequencies (4-8 Hz)
3. **Start Low**: Begin with lower volumes and adjust as needed
4. **Regular Practice**: Use daily for 10-30 minutes for best results
5. **Comfortable Environment**: Find a quiet, comfortable place to listen

## ⚙️ Recommended Settings

- **For Calm Mind**: 852 Hz (Solfeggio Frequency)
- **For Focus/Study**: 15 Hz (Beta waves, 14-20 Hz range)
- **For Deep Sleep**: 2 Hz (Delta waves, 1-3 Hz range)
- **Base Frequency**: 200 Hz (most comfortable for most people)
- **Volume**: 20-40% (should be gentle and non-intrusive)

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Web App Issues:**
- **Audio not playing?** Check browser permissions for audio
- **Sliders not working?** Try refreshing the page
- **Export not working?** Make sure you have enough disk space
- **Mobile issues?** Use Chrome or Safari for best compatibility

### **Desktop App Issues:**
- **Import Error?** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Audio Error?** Install audio drivers and restart
- **GUI not showing?** Check Python version (3.7+ required)
- **MP3 export fails?** Install ffmpeg for MP3 support

### **Common Solutions:**
```bash
# Fix Python dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Fix audio issues (Windows)
# Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable

# Fix audio issues (Mac)
# Install PortAudio: brew install portaudio

# Fix audio issues (Linux)
# Install ALSA: sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
```
