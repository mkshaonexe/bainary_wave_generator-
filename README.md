A powerful desktop application for generating scientifically-tuned binaural beats to enhance your mental state - whether you need focus, calm, or deep sleep.

## ✨ Features

- **🎵 Continuous Playback**: Smooth, uninterrupted audio streaming
- **⚡ Three Scientific Presets**: 
  - 🧠 **Stop Overthinking / Calm Mind** (852 Hz) - Solfeggio frequency for awakening intuition
  - 📚 **Focus / Study / Learning** (14-20 Hz Beta) - Improves attention and working memory
  - 😴 **Deep Sleep / Healing** (1-3 Hz Delta) - Mimics slow-wave sleep, helps with insomnia
- **💾 Export to WAV**: Save custom binaural beats for any duration
- **🎨 Beautiful GUI**: Modern, intuitive interface
- **🔧 Advanced Controls**: Customizable frequencies and settings

## 📥 Quick Start

### Option 1: Download Standalone Executable (Recommended)

1. Download the `.exe` file
2. Double-click to run
3. Choose a preset and click PLAY! 🎧

### Option 2: Run from Source Code

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mkshaonexe/bainary_wave_generator-.git
cd bainary_wave_generator-

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application

```

That's it! 🎉

## 🧠 What are the Different Frequencies?

### 🧠 Solfeggio Frequency (852 Hz)
- **Ancient sacred frequency**
- Awakens intuition and inner strength
- Helps clear overthinking and mental clutter
- Returns to spiritual order and clarity
- Promotes calm, peaceful mental state

### 📚 Beta Waves (14-20 Hz)
- **Active concentration and focus**
- Improves attention and working memory
- Enhances learning and cognitive performance
- Perfect for study and work sessions

### 😴 Delta Waves (1-3 Hz)
- **Deep sleep and healing**
- Mimics slow-wave sleep patterns
- Helps with insomnia and sleep disorders
- Promotes physical healing and recovery

## 🔊 How Binaural Beats Work

Binaural beats work by playing two slightly different frequencies in each ear:
- **Left ear**: Base frequency (e.g., 200 Hz)
- **Right ear**: Base frequency + Theta frequency (e.g., 206 Hz)

Your brain perceives the difference (6 Hz in this example) as a rhythmic beat, which can help entrain your brainwaves to the theta frequency range.

## 🎧 Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Headphones**: Binaural beats only work when each ear receives a different frequency
2. **Find Your Sweet Spot**: Experiment with different theta frequencies (4-8 Hz)
3. **Start Low**: Begin with lower volumes and adjust as needed
4. **Regular Practice**: Use daily for 10-30 minutes for best results
5. **Comfortable Environment**: Find a quiet, comfortable place to listen

## ⚙️ Recommended Settings

- **For Calm Mind**: 852 Hz (Solfeggio Frequency)
- **For Focus/Study**: 15 Hz (Beta waves, 14-20 Hz range)
- **For Deep Sleep**: 2 Hz (Delta waves, 1-3 Hz range)
- **Base Frequency**: 200 Hz (most comfortable for most people)
- **Volume**: 20-40% (should be gentle and non-intrusive)

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

- Start with short sessions (5-10 minutes) and gradually increase
- Do not use while driving or operating machinery
- Discontinue use if you experience dizziness or discomfort
- Consult a healthcare professional if you have epilepsy or other neurological conditions
- This is not a medical device and should not replace professional medical advice

## 🛠️ Technical Details
