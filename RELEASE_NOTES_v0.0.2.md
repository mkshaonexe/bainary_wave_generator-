# 🎉 Theta Wave Generator v0.0.2 - Continuous Playback Fix

## 🚀 What's Fixed in This Release

### 🎵 **Major Improvement: Continuous Playback**

**No more gaps!** We've completely eliminated the uncomfortable 2-second loop gaps that interrupted your meditation.

**Before:**
- Audio played for 2 seconds
- Brief pause/gap
- Loop repeated (uncomfortable!)

**Now:**
- ✅ Smooth, continuous audio streaming
- ✅ No interruptions or gaps
- ✅ Perfect for meditation and relaxation
- ✅ Seamless theta wave generation

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Stream-based Audio**: Changed from chunk-based to continuous stream playback
- **Phase Continuity**: Maintains smooth sine waves across audio blocks
- **Callback System**: Real-time audio generation with no buffering gaps
- **Lower Latency**: Smaller block sizes for more responsive playback

## 🔊 How It Works

Binaural beats work by playing two slightly different frequencies:
- **Left ear:** Base frequency (e.g., 200 Hz)
- **Right ear:** Base frequency + Theta frequency (e.g., 206 Hz)

Your brain perceives the difference (6 Hz) as a rhythmic beat, helping entrain your brainwaves to the theta frequency range for:
- Deep relaxation
- Reduced overthinking
- Enhanced meditation
- Better sleep quality
- Increased creativity

## 📋 System Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 7 or later (64-bit)
- **RAM:** 100 MB minimum
- **Disk Space:** 30 MB
- **Audio:** Headphones or earbuds (REQUIRED for binaural effect)
- **Internet:** Not required (works completely offline)

## ⚠️ Important Tips

✓ **MUST use headphones** - Binaural beats only work in stereo  
✓ Keep volume comfortable (20-40%)  
✓ Start with 5-15 minute sessions  
✓ Don't use while driving or operating machinery  
✓ Find a quiet, comfortable place
